      <description>Customer Lifetime Value CLV with Machine Learning using RFM Features
In this blog we will wrangle customer spend and behavior data to engineer recency, frequency and monetary value features as input to our model which will predict the probability of a customer spending, as well as how much they are predicted to spend.
This can help marketers identify and target customers they are highly likely to spend, as well customers that are highly likely to spend even more.</description>
